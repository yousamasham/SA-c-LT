# SA-c-LT

SA(c)LT (stands for Socks for ACL Tears) is a biomedical device built to aid athletes with their return to sport. The device is mounted onto socks that are worn by the athletes as they perform the hop test, a terminal rehabilitation stage test for patients who undergo ACL reconstruction surgery. Using an accelorometer, a gyroscope, and force sensors the LSI is calculated and sent to the user's phone over Bluetooth. SA(c)LT also provides its user with progression indications along the rehabilitation journey.
